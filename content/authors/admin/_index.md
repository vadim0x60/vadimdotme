Hello, world. I write on software, machine learning and its applications in healthcare. I am currently working towards a PhD in Deep Program Induction for Personal Healthcare at [TU Eindhoven](https://tue.nl) and [Philips Research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/locations/eindhoven.html). I organize [Eindhoven Reinforcement Learning Seminar](http://einreise.tilda.ws/).
